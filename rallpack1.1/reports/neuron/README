This directory contains the hoc files for performing the
Rallpack simulations using NEURON version 2.43

Each directory has a series of .hoc files used for performing the simulations
at assorted model sizes and timesteps.

These simulations were run by U.S. Bhalla and David H. Bilitch at Caltech,
July 1992. To the best of our knowledge they are a reasonable implementation
of the simulations in NEURON. We would welcome corrections and updated
benchmark results from more experienced users. Please address comments to  :
